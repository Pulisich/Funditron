                <h3>What uses does the Funditron have?</h3>
                <p>
                    Well, it can be used to measure an estimate of performance from a computer, taking into acount that the lesser the processing capacity, the less time it takes before it has to be shut down or risk hardware overheating.
                    <br />
                    It can also be used as a pranking device, to skip work, sabotage, etcetera.
                </p>


                <h3>WHY?!</h3>
                <p>
                As a kid I was very fond of robots, software, and science fiction, and I always enjoyed playing mad scientist, and all of this is just a long and over complicated way of saying: I was bored and I needed to practice.
                </p>


                <h3>Can it be used on cellphones?</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>DO NOT USE IT ON CELLPHONES</b>
                    
                    <br />
                    On a computer it may cause overheating, theoretically speaking, in cellphones overheating may lead the battery to explode.
          

                </p>

                
                <h3>Why should I hire you as a programmer then?</h3>
                <p>
                    Because I truly love what I am doing and I want to learn to do it better, and the best way to learn is by doing.
                   <br/>
                   I am willing to learn what companies have to teach me, and as long as they are willing to invest in me, I will make sure that investment will not be in vain.
                   <br />
                   Besides, as long as I do not have a job I will be forced to further practice, which means more projects, more complicated projects, with the potential of destroying the Earth :D.

                    <br />
